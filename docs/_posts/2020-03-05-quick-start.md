# Quick Start

This tutorial is meant to familiarize you with how Bakery works as a proxy to be able to filter your manifest.


## Setting up your Origin

Origin hosts are currently managed by the video-processing-team. If you would like to configure your origin to use Bakery as a proxy, reach out by simply hopping into our channel in <a href="https://cbs.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=i-vidtech-mediahub" target="_blank">Slack</a> and we'll get you setup!

In the meantime, check out the <a href="https://github.com/cbsinteractive/bakery">project repo</a> to run Bakery in your local environment!

Once we have configured Bakery to point to your origin, if you have the following playback URL `http://streaming.cbsi.video/star_trek_discovery/S01/E01.m3u8`

Then your `BAKERY_ORIGIN_HOST` was set to `http://streaming.cbsi.video` and your playback URL on the proxy will be `http://bakery.dev.cbsivideo.com/star_trek_discovery/S01/E01.m3u8`. 


## Working with Propeller as your Origin

Bakery can act as a proxy to serve your Propeller channels!

Propeller is a live-streaming platform that manages all of your cloud based resources. If you have a stream running out of Propeller, you can stream that channel via Bakery! 


To play a Propeller channel you can make a Bakery request with the following scheme:

    https://bakery.dev.cbsivideo.com/propeller/<org-id>/<channel-id>.m3u8

For more information on working with Propeller, check out the documentation 
<a href="https://cbsinteractive.github.io/propeller/">here</a> or reach out to the team on <a href="https://cbs.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=i-vidtech-propeller" target="_blank">Slack</a> to get all set up!


## Applying Filters

If you want to apply filters, they should be placed right after the Bakery hostname and before the path. Your requests should match the following schema:

    http://bakery.dev.cbsivideo.com/[filters]/path/to/master/manifest.m3u8

If working with a Propeller origin:

    http://bakery.dev.cbsivideo.com/[filters]/propeller/<org-id>/<channel-id>.m3u8


Following the examples above you can start applying filters like so:

1. **Single Filter**
    <br>To apply a single filter such as an audio codec filter where AC-3 audio is removed from the manifest, you can make a request to Bakery as so:

    ```
    http://bakery.dev.cbsivideo.com/a(ac-3)/star_trek_discovery/S01/E01.m3u8
    ```
    for a Propeller channel:
    ```
    http://bakery.dev.cbsivideo.com/a(ac-3)/propeller/<org-id>/<channel-id>.m3u8
    ```

2. **Multiple Values**
    <br>You can supply multiple values to each filter as you would like simply by using `,` as your delimiter for each value. 

    The following example will filter out AC-3 audio and Enhanced AC-3 audio from the manifest:

    ```
    http://bakery.dev.cbsivideo.com/a(ac-3,ec-3)/star_trek_discovery/S01/E01.m3u8
    ```
    for a Propeller channel:
    ```
    http://bakery.dev.cbsivideo.com/a(ac-3,ec-3)/propeller/<org-id>/<channel-id>.m3u8
    ```

3. **Multiple Filters**
    <br>Mutliple Filters can be passed in. All that is needed is the `/` delimiter in between each filter. For example, if you wanted to remove AVC (H.264) video and AAC (MPEG-4) audio, you could make the following request to Bakery:

    ```
    http://bakery.dev.cbsivideo.com/a(mp4a)/v(avc)/star_trek_discovery/S01/E01.m3u8
    ```
    for a Propeller channel:
    ```
    http://bakery.dev.cbsivideo.com/a(mp4a)/v(avc)/propeller/<org-id>/<channel-id>.m3u8
    ```

4. **Nested Filters**
    <br>You can nest codec and bitrate filters within audio and video filters. For example, if you wanted to remove AAC (MPEG-4) audio and filter the results within 500 Kbps and 1Mbps, you could make the following request to Bakery:

    ```
    http://bakery.dev.cbsivideo.com/a(codecs(mp4a),b(500000,1000000))/star_trek_discovery/S01/E01.m3u8
    ```
    for a Propeller channel:
    ```
    http://bakery.dev.cbsivideo.com/a(codecs(mp4a),b(500000,1000000))/propeller/<org-id>/<channel-id>.m3u8
    ```

For more specific details and usage examples on specific filters and the values accepted by each, check out our documentation for filters <a href="/filters">here</a>!
